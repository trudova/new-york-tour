It is the most visited urban park in the United States with an estimated 38 million visitors annually, and is the most filmed location in the world. Following proposals for a large park in Manhattan during the 1840s, it was approved in 1853 to cover 778 acres. In 1857, the landscape architects Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux won a design competition for the park with their Greensward Plan. Construction began the same year, and the park's first areas were opened to the public in late 1858"
